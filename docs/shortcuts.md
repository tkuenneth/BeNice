To use the **App Pairs** you create in *Be nice*, you use Android Shortcuts. There are two types:

### 1. Pinned Shortcuts
These are icons placed directly on your home screen, separate from the main app icon.
* **Note:** While most phones support this, some custom home screen apps (launchers) may not allow automatic pinning.

### 2. Dynamic Shortcuts
These are system-managed links that offer the most flexibility. They appear in two places:
* **On your Home Screen:** **Long-press** the *Be nice* icon to reveal a menu of your App Pairs. You can usually drag these out to create standalone icons.
* **Inside the App:** *Be nice* reads these shortcuts directly from the system to display them in the app's list. This ensures your App Pairs are always in sync.
